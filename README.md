# About Me
I have experience in front-end development in the industry and a self-taught full-stack developer (study back-end and dev-ops).

My goal is that I can build anything as I want and becoming a software architect in this industry. After I have been worked for two years, I realized that I have to work on my own project first so that I could have more time to cover more comprehensive knowledge. In order to achieve this goal, I quit my job and study online to enhance my knowledge by studying algorithm and system design. In practice level, I strongly believe to build an enterprise level product from scratch is the best way and the only way to go.
