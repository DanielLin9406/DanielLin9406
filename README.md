## 👋  𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗠𝗲
I am a Taiwanese. Please call me Daniel.
I am a person who desires to meet new things, challenges and new ideas.
I have experience in front-end development in the industry and a self-taught full-stack developer (study back-end and dev-ops). 

## 🤟  𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹
My goal is that I can build anything as I want and becoming a software architect in this industry. After I have been worked for two years, I realized that I have to work on my own project first so that I could have more time to cover more comprehensive knowledge. In order to achieve this goal, I quit my job and study online to enhance my knowledge by studying algorithm and system design. In practice level, I strongly believe to build an enterprise level product from scratch is the best way and the only way to go.

Building a US stock screener based on the financial statement from www.sec.gov. This project means a lot for me. I can boost my career through this work in terms of technical knowledge and project management. See "Project: [Full-stack: Lazy-stock-screener-demo](#Full-stack:-[Price-dashboard])" section for more details.

## 📂 Projects
### Full-stack: [Lazy-stock-screener-demo](https://github.com/lazy-stock-screener-demo)
A US stock screener based on the financial statement from www.sec.gov. Design a system from use-case/user story to CI/CD. It leverages all the ideas or principles listed in the following: highly decoupled components, event-driven design, and SOLID principles. A MVP pattern is in front-end with React Hooks; Using Clean Architecture and DDD best practices with Golang in the back-end; Data pipeline is built on top of Python with various design patterns. Everything is containerized with Docker and managed by Kubernetes, while Gitlab CI/CD helped me to deploy this project to the GKE. The main project is privated and on gitlab, therefore, only part of this project are demonstrated on github origanization.

### Full-stack: [Price Dashboard](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)

An internal SPA for the purpose of setting and reading prices in terms of each product in the online shop. The tech stack is MERN (react-redux, node, express, mongoDB) with Docker/Kubernetes and system structure is based on microservice architecture. The details tech-stack are Webpack/SPA/Google OAuth2/Node/Mocha/Apollo Server/MongoDB/Redis/Nginx/Docker/K8S/TravisCI/Terraform.

### Data Pipeline: [US Stock Financial Report Dumper](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/worker-financialReportScreenr)
* A python version financial report dumper with Pandas/Google Sheet API/
* I also implement various design pattern like: 
  * TableAbstractFactory
  * ScoreTableStrategy
  * BuyDecisionStrategy
  * InputPipeLine
  * APIMediator
  * OutputObserver
  * Chain of Responsibility/Builder
