### Full-stack: [LZStock](https://lzstock.app)

(Now is on Stage 1)

LZStock is a stock screener that saves you time to help you make decisions quickly. 

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬?   
- This is a self-initiated project built to demonstrate my comprehensive understanding of how to construct a fundamental, general-purpose, production-ready system.
- I chose an interesting topic: A US stock screener based on financial statements sourced from www.sec.gov.
- This project centers on developing a foundational framework, exploring best practices, and acquiring experience through genuine challenges.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞?
- Encompassed the entire development lifecycle, from initial design through to final deployment.
- Leveraged DDD (Domain-Driven Design) to design the Domain and Bounded Context based on business requirements.
- I personally owned this product and built it single-handedly within 100 days.

- Golang's type alias mechanism is suitable for DDD, as it allows defining rich domain types without the performance or memory footprint of creating complex structs.
- The test strategy is enhanced by DDD because its domain objects are structured as self-contained units, facilitating straightforward unit testing without external dependencies.
