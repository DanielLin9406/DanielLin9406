## 👋 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗠𝗲
I am a quick learner, able to grasp new concepts efficiently and effectively. In 2016, after obtaining a master’s degree in science, I decided to shift my career path and became a Software Engineer. After two years as a front-end developer and three years as a full-stack developer, I realized my foundational knowledge needed strengthening. In 2023, alongside starting my own project, I returned to school to study the fundamentals of computer science, which included problem decomposition, C++, database design, system design, algorithms, and data structures, among other topics.

## 🤟 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹
My goal is to become a certified senior engineer, to think on a broader scale, and to lead my team with empathy. I aim to practice perspective-taking and make strategic trade-offs when working with limited resources. On the product side, I seek to translate abstract guiding principles into concrete, actionable steps and deliverables through constant communication and collaboration. Regarding my technical learning journey, I remain open-minded, with the ultimate goal of researching and selecting the most suitable solutions within the constraints of available resources.
