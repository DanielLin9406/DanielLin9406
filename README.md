## 👋 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗠𝗲
I am a quick learner, able to grasp new concepts efficiently and effectively. In 2016, after obtaining a master’s degree in science, I decided to shift my career path and became a Software Engineer. After two years as a front-end developer and three years as a full-stack developer, I realized my foundational knowledge needed strengthening. In 2023, alongside starting my own project, I returned to school to study the fundamentals of computer science, which included problem decomposition, C++, database design, system design, algorithms, and data structures, among other topics.

## 🤟 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹
My goal is to become a certified senior engineer, to think on a broader scale, and to lead my team with empathy. I aim to practice perspective-taking and make strategic trade-offs when working with limited resources. On the product side, I seek to translate abstract guiding principles into concrete, actionable steps and deliverables through constant communication and collaboration. Regarding my technical learning journey, I remain open-minded, with the ultimate goal of researching and selecting the most suitable solutions within the constraints of available resources.

## 📂 Portfolios
### Full-stack: [Lazy-stock-screener-demo](https://github.com/lazy-stock-screener-demo)
A US stock screener based on the financial statement from www.sec.gov. Design a system from use-case/user story to CI/CD. It leverages all the ideas or principles listed in the following: highly decoupled components, event-driven design, and SOLID principles. A MVP pattern is in front-end with React Hooks; Using Clean Architecture and DDD best practices with Golang in the back-end; Data pipeline is built on top of Python with various design patterns. Everything is containerized with Docker and managed by Kubernetes, while Gitlab CI/CD helped me to deploy this project to the GKE. The main project is privated and on gitlab, therefore, only part of this project are demonstrated on github origanization.

### Full-stack: [Price Dashboard](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)

An internal SPA for the purpose of setting and reading prices in terms of each product in the online shop. The tech stack is MERN (react-redux, node, express, mongoDB) with Docker/Kubernetes and system structure is based on microservice architecture. The details tech-stack are Webpack/SPA/Google OAuth2/Node/Mocha/Apollo Server/MongoDB/Redis/Nginx/Docker/K8S/TravisCI/Terraform.

### Data Pipeline: [US Stock Financial Report Dumper](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/worker-financialReportScreenr)
A python version financial report dumper with Pandas/Google Sheet API/
I explore various design pattern like: 
  * TableAbstractFactory
  * ScoreTableStrategy
  * BuyDecisionStrategy
  * InputPipeLine
  * APIMediator
  * OutputObserver
  * Chain of Responsibility/Builder
